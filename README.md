# Stickopy

This little piece of software, developed in [Dart](https://dart.dev/), allows you to copy the whole content of a USB drive automatically (when plugged), quickly and quietly.  
  
## How to compile?
See [COMPILING.md](https://github.com/FLA-Coding/Stickopy/blob/main/COMPILING.md).

## Stickopy is detected as a virus by my antivirus!
Indeed, [some antiviruses detect Stickopy as a Trojan](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/afbc44c11cb97079d9ca382eea650b19f004daa68e5e983e68bf98849e377579/detection). This is due to the quiet behavior of Stickopy and the fact that it regularly scans all USB devices connected.  
However, we understand that it can be difficult to trust a program detected as malware.  
If it is your case, we encourage you to [review the source code](https://github.com/FLA-Coding/Stickopy/blob/main/bin/stickopy.dart) and [build Stickopy yourself](https://github.com/FLA-Coding/Stickopy/blob/main/COMPILING.md).
